## Exam 2016/17

### Question 1

**(c)** Working directory, Index (Stage), HEAD

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Working directory/workspace** | Directory tree of files that you see and edit. Contains unstaged changes and untracked files. |
| **Index (Stage)/staging area**  | Area where you can add files to start drafting a commit.                                      |
| **HEAD/repository**             | Commits. Is tracked by the `.git` folder                                                      |

### Question 2

**(b)** Encapsulation refers to the possibility of defining public classes inside other classes.

This is actually called **nesting**, where the nested class is the class defined inside another class. This is not a fundamental principle of OOP, since it does not contribute to the overall code structure, it just establishes a class can be defined inside the namespace of another class.

Although it is quite widely supported (Java, C++, Python), there are still some languages that do not support nesting (JavaScript ES6 classes can't be nested).

**Encapsulation** refers to isolation of member functions and variables from the outside world, exposing only an interface to the class accompanied by documentation if needed.

### Question 3

**(b)** `final`

Obviously, `final` is not required in treating Java exceptions, as opposed to the other options which are mandatory to treat exceptions (`try`, `throw`, `catch`).

`final` is used to declare a constant pointer to an object (the object is not constant, only the reference can not be made to point to another object other than the one it is initially assigned)

### Question 4

**(d)** The expression does not need those many parenthesis.

```java
System.out.println("c" + (a ? "a" : "b"));
```
It does need them all. The outer parenthesis limit the function arguments, so they are obviously necessary.

The inner parenthesis are also necessary, otherwise the argument would become

```java
"c" + a ? "a" : "b"
```

which would either give an error (if `a` could not be converted to `String`), or give a `String` where a `boolean`/`Boolean` is expected.

### Question 5

**(b)** In case a class destructor is defined, it will have to be called explicitly, otherwise the garbage collection mechanism will ignore it.

Java does not have destructors.

### Question 6

**(b)** `TreeSet<Double>`

| Option                      | Explanation                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(a)** `ArrayList<double>` | Not intrinsically ordered, nor does it intrinsically check for duplicates                       |
| **(d)** `HashSet<double>`   | Not ordered                                                                                     |
| **(e)** `TreeMap<Double>`   | Illegal declaration, since `Map`s require a key and a value, but only the key type is specified |

### Question 7

**(d)** The object returned by this method cannot be of type `T`, since only arguments can be parametrizes for this type of methods.

There is nothing wrong in returning `T`, it is correctly defined.

### Question 8

**(a)** `class C4 implements I1 extends C2 { private HashSet<C3> r3; }`

Trivial from the UML class diagram.

### Question 9

**(e)** There cannot be multiple transitions with the same event and the same origin state.

??

### Question 10

**(e)** To make modifications to the internal program structure, to make it easier to understand and modify, without changing the observable behaviour of the program.

### Question 11

**(c)** Unit tests are not as effective if refactoring is not done *a priori*.

### Question 12

**(b)** Improve code quality, by testing flaws introduced in the code.

Mutation tests are tests applied by special frameworks, which create *mutations* of the original code to check if tests would be able to detect and kill those mutants. When improving tests to kill mutants, the programmer also has a chance to rethink minor details that might have gone unnoticed, such as `>` instead of `>=` for instance.

### Question 13

**(a)** To place and resize visual components inside a container, subject to a set of restrictions.

### Question 14

??

### Question 15

**(a)** Code becomes extensible, being enough to add new functionalities, without having to change pre-existing code.

### Question 16

**(d)** Develop code as generic and flexible as possible.

This incurs in [speculative generality](https://refactoring.guru/smells/speculative-generality), which means we are being far more generic than required, meaning some parts will never be used and also making the code harder to read because we implement features that will never be used for any purpose.

### Question 17

**(b)** Singleton and Object Pool

- [**Singleton**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton): the class has a static variable, and on calling `getInstance` either a new instance is created, or if already called the existing instance is returned.
- [**Object pool**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern): a set of resources is held and provided on demand, instead of being permanently created and destroyed.

### Question 18

**(e)** When we want objects' behaviour to change in runtime.

[Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) pattern should be used when we want to change an object's behaviour in runtime. However, it differs from [state](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state) since it does not specify transitions between behaviours/states, as State does.

### Question 19

**(d)** Allows the observer object to have access to the internal state of the observed object.

This is clearly not an advantage, since it means there is [inappropriate intimacy](https://refactoring.guru/smells/inappropriate-intimacy) between the observer and the observed.

### Question 20

**(b)** Move method.

| Option                                                            | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(a)** [Pull Up Method](https://refactoring.guru/pull-up-method) | If two classes with a common ancestor have duplicate methods, we can make them similar and then pull up the method to the common ancestor.                                                    |
| **(b)** [Move method](https://refactoring.guru/move-method)       | Move a method to the class which uses it the most. Has nothing to do with code duplication, since it is more a matter of responsibilities and about who uses the method more often.           |
| **(c)** [Extract Method](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method) | If two parts have duplicate code, we can make them similar, extract a method and then make each part call that method.                                                                        |
| **(e)** [Extract Class](https://refactoring.guru/extract-class)   | If two classes have lots of code in common, we can isolate those parts of code into similar methods, and then extract a class that those two initial classes will either use or descend from. |
