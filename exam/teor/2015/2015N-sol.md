# Exam 2014/15

## Question 1

**(b)** Encapsulation refers to the possibility of defining public classes inside other classes.

Same as [exam 2016/17](../2017/2017N-sol.md), question 2

## Question 2

**(b)** `onerror`

`onerror` is not even a Java keyword.

Similar to [exam 2015/16](../2016/2016N-sol.md), question 4.

## Question 3

**(e)** Mutation testing tools like [PIT](https://pitest.org/) are used to automatically generate new tests, by mutating existing tests based on generic algorithms.

Mutation testing tools do not create tests, they create mutants of the code being tested and evaluate which of those mutants are killed by the tests.

Property-based testing tools like [jqwik](https://jqwik.net/) make assertions in a way very similar to what is described in this option, by internally creating new tests based on the stated properties of input and output.

## Question 4

**(c)** Multiple inheritance, i.e. the possibility of a class to extend several classes.

| Option                                                                                   | Comment                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(b)** Lambda expressions.                                                              | Supported, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)      |
| **(c)** Multiple inheritance, i.e. the possibility of a class to extend several classes. | Not supported, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/multipleinheritance.html) |
| **(d)** Method references                                                                | Supported, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html)       |
| **(e)** Generic (or parametrized) types and methods                                      | Supported, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html)                |

## Question 5

**(c)** `TreeSet<Double>`

## Question 6

**(e)** Swing listeners are used to implements interfaces with voice recognition.

## Question 7

**(d)** Serialization allows to easily convert an object (and all objects referenced by it) into a sequence of bytes that can be sent to a stream (file, network, etc.).

## Question 8

**(b)** Develop Android applications that can easily addapt to multiple devices' dimensions.

## Question 9

??

## Question 10

**(c)** Allows to determine which methods consume the most execution time.

Similar to [exam 2015/16](../2016/2016N-sol.md), question 11

## Question 11

**(b)** dependency

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(a)** navigable association | ![](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association/class-navigability-navigable.png)    |
| **(b)** dependency            | ![](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core/class-dependency-usage.png)             |
| **(d)** generalization        | ![](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-generalizaion-separate.png) |
| **(e)** realization           | ![](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core/class-interface-realization.png)        |

## Question 12

**(d)** `class C4 implements I1 extends C2 { private HashSet<C3> r3; }`

## Question 13

**(b)** transition

Transitions are only used in state diagrams.

## Question 14

**(d)** There cannot be multiple transitions with the same event and same origin state.

Similar to [exam 2016/17](../2017/2017N-sol.md), question 9.

## Question 15

**(b)** [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)

## Question 16

**(a)** [State](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)

## Question 17

**(d)** [Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)

## Question 18

**(b)** To make modifications to the internal program structure, to make it easier to understand and modify, without changing the observable behaviour of the program.

Similar to [exam 2016/17](../2017/2017N-sol.md), question 10.

## Question 19

**(d)** [Lazy Class](https://refactoring.guru/smells/lazy-class)

| Option                                                                         | Comment                                                                                                         S |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(a)** [Switch Statements](https://refactoring.guru/smells/switch-statements) | Can be solved, by extracting all the `if`-knowledge into a different function.                                   |
| **(b)** [Long Method](https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-method)             | Most obvious refactor for a long method.                                                                         |
| **(c)** [Duplicated code](https://refactoring.guru/smells/duplicate-code)      | In most situations, first you make the duplicate code similar in the places it appears, and then extract method. |
| **(d)** [Lazy Class](https://refactoring.guru/smells/lazy-class)               | If the class is lazy it already has little code to extract a method from.                                        |
